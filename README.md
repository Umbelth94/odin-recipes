# odin-recipes
Odin recipe project using HTML

The purpose of this project is to utilize what I have learned in HTML to create a basic website featuring recipes that I love.

I will be incorporating what I have learned about links, lists, html formatting, and file structure.  Additionally, any files or directories necessary will be created and modified via the terminal to help enforce muscle memory.  I will also be using this project to build good habits regarding commits, and getting used to using git through the command console to push my project to github.

Later, I will revisit this once I have furthered my understanding of CSS to make it actually look nice.  

If you've read this far then I thank you and hope you have a nice day!
