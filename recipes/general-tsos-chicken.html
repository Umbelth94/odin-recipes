    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of life's simplest pleasures is ordering unhealthy portions of chinese takeout that comes with it's own "free" microwave un-safe tupperware and enough MSG to finally make you <em>feel </em> something.  Unfortunately, a good majority of Chinese Restaraunts utilize peanut oil to fry up their goods.  This makes their food delicious. Unfortunately it also makes their food incredibly <em>deadly</em> to people with nut allergies, such as my lovely girlfriend.</p>

        <p>Because of this allergy, I was forced to choose between two things that I love so very much. It was a real "<em>Love</em>, or <em>Lamian</em>" situation.  For months I wrestled with this painful peanut-based dilemma.  Even worse was the realization that my girlfriend was never going to experience the mind-expanding flavors that accompanied a perfectly cooked (but maybe a bit too bready) dish of General Tso's Chicken. </p>

        <p>But then it hit me.  It didn't have to be this way.  After all, I knew how to cook things (sort of), and I had the means to do it.  I even knew how to use google to find recipes for things that I wanted to eat.  Most importantly, I was dating someone who had never eaten General Tso's chicken... <strong>SOMETHING</strong> had to change.</p>

        <p>So anyway, we googled a recipe that didn't involve peanuts, and after having cooked it a half dozen times, we are now confident that it won't be a disaster if we feed it to other people. I feel ready to share our slightly revised (but mostly total rip-off) recipe of another one that we found online.</p> 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the <strong>chicken</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chicken thighs cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic <em>minced</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the <strong>sauce</strong></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toss the chicken thighs with the quarter cup of cornstarch and let sit while you mix the sauce ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add the rice vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, water, sugar and tablespoon of cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk together.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken to a pan with the oil and fry until crispy.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the pan and drain all but a tablespoon of the oil and add the chili flakes, ginger and garlic.</li>
                <li>Cook until you smell the garlic (about 30 seconds)</li>
                <li>Add in the chicken and toss, then add in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you thinly chop some brocolli, you can fry the brocolli in the leftover sauce on the pan once you've taken all of the chicken.  I promise you it will be the best improvised stir-fry brocolli you've ever had.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    
            </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For the full "Chinese Restaraunt" experience, make some rice and brocolli to tie it all together.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put the saucy chicken in a bowl over the rice and brocolli.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This isn't going to perfectly recreate the true taste of <em>"Authentic"</em> General Tso's from your local Chinese joint, so don't expect that to be the case. 
                <ul>
                    <li>However, this still tastes <strong>really</strong> good, and the best part is that it won't kill anyone who is allergic to peanuts!</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Seriously though, have fun! </li>
            </ul>
