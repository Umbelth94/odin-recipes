    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of life's simplest pleasures is ordering unhealthy portions of chinese takeout that comes with it's own "free" microwave un-safe tupperware and enough MSG to finally make you <em>feel </em> something.  Unfortunately, a good majority of Chinese Restaraunts utilize peanut oil to fry up their goods.  This makes their food delicious. Unfortunately it also makes their food incredibly <em>deadly</em> to people with nut allergies, such as my lovely girlfriend.</p>

        <p>Because of this allergy, I was forced to choose between two things that I love so very much. It was a real "<em>Love</em>, or <em>Lamian</em>" situation.  For months I wrestled with this painful peanut-based dilemma.  Even worse was the realization that my girlfriend was never going to experience the mind-expanding flavors that accompanied a perfectly cooked (but maybe a bit too bready) dish of General Tso's Chicken. </p>

        <p>But then it hit me.  It didn't have to be this way.  After all, I knew how to cook things (sort of), and I had the means to do it.  I even knew how to use google to find recipes for things that I wanted to eat.  Most importantly, I was dating someone who had never eaten General Tso's chicken... <strong>SOMETHING</strong> had to change.</p>

        <p>So anyway, we googled a recipe that didn't involve peanuts, and after having cooked it a half dozen times before getting to a point where we are confident that it won't be a disaster if we feed it to other people, I feel confident in sharing our slightly revised recipe (but mostly total rip-off) of another one that we found online.</p>
