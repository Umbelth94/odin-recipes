        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an excellent nacho recipe that utilizes the instant pot to make a perfectly moist and flavor packed tray of chicken nachos that will absolutely knock your socks off.  There is a lot of variation to the recipe and you can apply your own artistic twists (or as my girlfriend calls them, <em>"ingredients"</em>) to it, but the core process will remain the same each and every time.  All you need to do is read through my tragic backstory and then read the recipe.  
        </p>
        <p>"Insert tragic backstory here"</p>
        <p>Alright, without further ado, here is the recipe!!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1/2 pounds medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of taco seasoning
                <ul>
                    <li>Honestly, you need enough taco seasoning to just coat the hell out of both sides of each piece of chicken.  It's usually more than a tablespoon.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2 cups of mild salsa
                <ul>
                    <li>I personally use <a href="https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=56584&retailer_id=457&region_id=6546741446&utm_medium=sem_shopping&utm_source=instacart_google&utm_campaign=ad_demand_shopping_rp_food-pantry&utm_content=accountid-8145171519_campaignid-16074540121_adgroupid-140251574291_device-c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pCVBhCFARIsAGMxhAc4qWGYfk90Ep6wga8_GQAgLadFYImAjmPQ3uyqv9h3btMXLcV-ZFwaAs3hEALw_wcB">Xochitl Asada Verde Salsa </a>, but you can use any salsa that you think would work well.  Salsa Verde tends to work best, personally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice (The bottled stuff is fine too)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of chopped cilantro
                <ul>
                    <li>This is optional.  Cilantro tastes like soap to me but people really seem to like it, so maybe I'm the weird one.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Half a bag of tortilla chips
                <ul>
                    <li>Donkey chips are my go to chip for this, and I definitely use more than half a bag...
                        <ul>
                            <li>They have a salt free option if you're interested in living past 50, but it isn't gonna hit the same.</li>
                            <li>Seriously though they're so good.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2 cups of whatever shredded cheese flavor you like.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheddar is preferred</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li><em>Roasted</em> Poblano Pepper
                    <ul>
                    <li>Roast this badboy in the oven at 400 degrees for like 15 minutes beforehand and then chop it up to use later.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Green/Yellow/Orange Pepper</li>
            <li>Jalepeno</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Feel free to use other vegetables and otppings, but the above toppings are the most crucial</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
