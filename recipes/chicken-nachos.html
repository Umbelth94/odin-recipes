    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an excellent nacho recipe that utilizes the instant pot to make a perfectly moist and flavor packed tray of chicken nachos that will absolutely knock your socks off.  There is a lot of variation to the recipe and you can apply your own artistic twists (or as my girlfriend calls them, <em>"ingredients"</em>) to it, but the core process will remain the same each and every time.  All you need to do is read through my tragic backstory and then read the recipe.  
        </p>
        <p>"Insert tragic backstory here"</p>
        <p>Alright, without further ado, here is the recipe!!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1/2 pounds medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of taco seasoning
                <ul>
                    <li>Honestly, you need enough taco seasoning to just coat the hell out of both sides of each piece of chicken.  It's usually more than a tablespoon.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2 cups of mild salsa
                <ul>
                    <li>I personally use <a href="https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=56584&retailer_id=457&region_id=6546741446&utm_medium=sem_shopping&utm_source=instacart_google&utm_campaign=ad_demand_shopping_rp_food-pantry&utm_content=accountid-8145171519_campaignid-16074540121_adgroupid-140251574291_device-c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pCVBhCFARIsAGMxhAc4qWGYfk90Ep6wga8_GQAgLadFYImAjmPQ3uyqv9h3btMXLcV-ZFwaAs3hEALw_wcB">Xochitl Asada Verde Salsa </a>, but you can use any salsa that you think would work well.
                        <ul>
                            <li>(You should definitely use some kind of Salsa Verde though)</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice (The bottled stuff is fine too)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of chopped cilantro
                <ul>
                    <li>This is optional.  Cilantro tastes like soap to me but people really seem to like it, so maybe I'm the weird one.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Half a bag of tortilla chips
                <ul>
                    <li>Donkey chips are my go to chip for this, and I definitely use more than half a bag...
                        <ul>
                            <li>They have a salt free option if you're interested in living past 50, but it isn't gonna hit the same.</li>
                            <li>Seriously though they're so good.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2 cups of whatever shredded cheese flavor you like.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheddar is preferred</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>1 onion diced</li>
            <li><em>Roasted</em> Poblano Pepper
                    <ul>
                    <li>Roast this badboy in the oven at 400 degrees for like 15 minutes beforehand and then chop it up to use later.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1 Green/Yellow/Orange Pepper diced</li>
            <li>1 Jalepeno sliced</li>
            <li>1 Tomato diced</li>
            <li>1 Can of corn kernels</li>
            <li>Feel free to use other vegetables and toppings, but the above toppings are the most crucial</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Season all sides of the chicken with taco seasoning</li>
            <li>Place chicken, salsa, lime juice, and cilantro(optional) into the pot and give it all a stir.  
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a bit of salsa to the bottom of the pot before placing the chicken to help keep the chicken from burning at the bottom of the pot.  Otherwise, you run the risk of getting a "burn" error on your instant pot and this not only burns the chicken, but means you have to wait <em>even longer</em> for your chicken nachos. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook for 9 minutes at high pressure, and then quick release the pressure once the alarm goes off.  Check that chicken temp is at 165 degrees Fahrenheit. </li>
            <li>Preheat the broiler on your oven.  Cover a sheet pan with parchment or foil for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>While the oven broiler is warming up, place the chicken breast into a bowl and shred it apart with two forks, then place it back into the instant pot so that it can soak up the salsa juices</li>
            <li>Spread out a thin layer of the tortilla chips onto the pan and give it a light sprinkle of cheese, chicken, and any of the extra toppings. <strong>(DO NOT ADD TOMATO YET)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save most of the cheese/toppings for the next layer.  This is a tried and true method that I use to ensure that there is no chip left behind</li>
                    <li>I also encourage you to not use all of the shredded chicken for the nachos in general.  You can use the chicken for tacos later, or <em>even more nachos!!</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Spread out the final layer of your chips.  Throw the rest of your cheese, chicken and toppings <strong>(EXCEPT THE TOMATOES)</strong> onto the chips.
            <ul>
                <li>Try not to let too much chicken juice get on the nachos, or the chips will get all soggy :(</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Once the oven is pre-heated, throw the tray of nachos into the oven for... <em>about</em> a minute and a half.
                <ul>
                    <li>The timing here varies depending on how efficient your oven is.  At approximately 1.5 minutes, check to see if your cheese has melted.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it hasn't melted, leave it in but check on it every 30 seconds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once the cheese has melted, pull out the nachos and let them cool for 2 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>NOW</strong> you put on the tomatoes. </li>
            <li>Chow down</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It tastes better when you eat it directly off of the tray</li>
            <li>If you didn't end up using all of your chicken on the nachos, you can store the rest of it for nachos in the future, or even some tasty shredded chicken tacos.</li>
            <li>The broiler in your oven is a powerful, powerful thing.  Don't underestimate how quickly it will burn your nachos.</li>
            <li>But most importantly... Remember to have <strong>FUN</strong></li>
        </ul>
