        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These are some good ol' Vegetarian Enchiladas using nothing but ingredients you could find at your local farmer's market.  The lady and I were looking for some healthier bulk meal options for ourselves that didn't involve shoving copious amounts of meat down our gullets like usual, and came across this recipe online.  It is quite delicious and the enchiladas themselves are very large so even one of these is enough to fill up a tiny stomach.</p>
